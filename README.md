## What's Going On
WeatherBot was my pilot GroupMe bot when I wanted to created a bot that would remind my friends who had to clean the bathroom. It uses Python, GroupMe API, and National Weather Service API. 

I'm trying to get it to work on Heroku but am having trouble, still would like it to work on there because I think it's valuable info to know.

Right now, a modified version of WeatherBot is being run on [PythonAnywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) and is used in my hall's floor group chat. My RA heard of my project and asked me to add WeatherBot to the floor group chat, so I did.

## The WeatherBot Saga
There was once had a crazy [email chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/apchsx/top_ten_photos_taken_seconds_before_disaster/) that involved 10,000+ Pitt students continuously replying all. Eventually a riot broke out in the Quad where people began to spam "Sicko Mode" and "Mo Bamba", shoot Nerf bullets at each other, and throw snowballs at Pitt Police.

Being that I live on upper-campus, my fellow honor students and I could not witness this crap-show. Instead, students went into the Honors GroupMe groupchat and began spamming memes and what not. 

Looking to join in, my roommates and I decided to deploy WeatherBot. I would keep the bot on a continuous loop spamming the weather report as soon as possible. 

It went over as well as one could imagine.
